# Lokal.Ind Machine Learning Models

Welcome to the official repository of the Lokal.Ind Machine Learning Models project. This repository hosts the models developed for the Lokal.Ind E-Commerce Platform to enhance user experience through predictive text suggestions and personalized product recommendations.

## Overview

Project Overview: This project encompasses the development and deployment of two primary machine learning models - a Next Word Prediction Model and a Recommender System. These models are integrated into the Lokal.Ind Android application to provide intelligent features that improve user engagement and satisfaction.

## Features

### Next Word Prediction Model

- **Purpose:** Enhance user experience by predicting the next word as they type, offering suggestions to complete their input quickly and accurately.
- **Technology Stack:** TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, Pandas
- **Training Data:** Item name corpus of text data relevant to eCommerce and user interactions.
- **Deployment:** Integrated into the Android application and Cloud for real-time predictions.

### Recommender System

- **Purpose:** Provide personalized product recommendations based on queries user and preferences.
- **Technology Stack:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow
- **Algorithms:** Content-Based Filtering
- **Training Data:** User interaction data & product metadata.
- **Deployment:** Integrated into the Android application to display personalized recommendations on the home screen, and queries search relevant based on similar item name.
